Braille to 26-letter alphabet translator (from file)
26-letter alphabet to braille translator (from file)
create file and print to screen 'created file_name containing xxx characters'

working questions:
-how would you take just the filename from an array element (to interpolate in a string)
 without changing the filepath its calling?
-why can I only run runner from inside the lib?
(even /lib/runner doesn't work when i'm in night writer)
